Writing investing bot using Tinkoff InvestAPI and Neural Networks

# Description
I'm trying to develop a trading bot using Tinkoff InvestAPI and Neural Networks.
The main idea: try to use conventional neural networks for stock's moving estimation. Moreover I'll try to add NLP models to estimate news headlines. 

After estimation I'm going to use the reinforcement learning approach. I'll study the student to search for the perfect strategy.
